   <h2>Lash Lift and<strong> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LashesPermTreat-1758038384488172/" title="go"><em>LashBotox</em> </a></strong> treatment procedure.</h2>
   <p>Say goodbye to uncomfortable and damaging eyelash curlers. Forget the old style lash perming. A lash lift is performed with a special silicon pad that is placed on your eyelid, allowing us to lift your lashes from the root to create a subtle, natural looking lift.</p>
   <br>The procedure uses two separate solutions. The first being a lifting agent and the second being a setting agent. If you choose to, you can follow this with a lash tint to darken your lashes.</br>
   <br>This treatment takes up to 1 hour and the end result lasts up to two months.It Is very relaxing procedure and most clients end up falling asleep.</p>
   <br>Lash Lift is now complimented by an additional treatment- Lash Botox. This is achieved using a substance that is applied on to the lashes after Lash Lift. Lash Botox contains Argan oil, keratin and amino acids to strengthen and hydrate your lashes. In addition it also makes your lashes look visually much thicker.</p>
   <br>If you already familiar with lash lifts then you are going to absolutely love lash botox. The ultimate lash upgrade and a brilliant new treatment.</p>
   <br>These are services that do not require home care, neither do they damage your lashes or impair the growth cycle. The only thing you need to do is keep your lashes dry for 1 hour after completion. After 1 hour you can wear mascara if you wish.</p>
